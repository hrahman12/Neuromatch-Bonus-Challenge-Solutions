This is Bonus content from the course, here I include mathematical derivation as well as code. I also include my own incorporations of Quantum Computing into these problems:- 


Model Fitting (W1D2)


-Tutorial 5 Model Selection Bias Variance trade-off: Bonus Exercise: Proof of bias-variance decomposition


-Tutorial 6: Model Selection Cross Validation: Bonus Section 1: Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)


-Autoencoders Tutorial 1

Biological Neuron Models (W2D3)


-Tutorial 3: Synaptic transmission - Models of static and dynamic synapses
  

Reinforcement Learning (W3D4)

Tutorial 3: Learning to Act: Q-Learning
